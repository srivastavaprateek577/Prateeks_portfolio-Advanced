# How to Run Your Portfolio

## 1. Install Dependencies
I have already started this for you, but if you need to do it again:
```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Start the Development Server
To see your website locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 3. Stop the Server
To stop the website from running, go to the terminal where it's running and press:
**`Ctrl + C`**
(You might need to press it twice or type `y` to confirm).

## 4. Deploy to the Web
To share your portfolio with the world, the easiest way is to use **Vercel**:

1.  Push your code to GitHub.
2.  Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up.
3.  Click "Add New Project" and select your repository.
4.  Click "Deploy".

Vercel will give you a live URL (e.g., `prateek-portfolio.vercel.app`).
